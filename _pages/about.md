I’m Lucas de Brito Sapienza, a Full-Stack Developer passionate about building scalable, secure, and user-focused web applications. With a background in Ruby on Rails and React, I’ve worked across Brazil, Australia, and the United States, helping startups and SaaS companies design, ship, and maintain products that serve thousands of users.

Currently, I’m part of the ConvertFlow team, where I develop and optimize features that power conversion-driven experiences for businesses worldwide. My work spans from backend architecture and infrastructure monitoring to frontend interfaces and customer integrations, always with a focus on performance, maintainability, and reliability.

Before ConvertFlow, I honed my skills at companies like SmartrMail (Melbourne), LocalLabs (Chicago), and Rebase (São Paulo), tackling challenges ranging from high-volume data pipelines (100M+ records) to global SaaS rollouts across Latin America. Along the way, I’ve also built custom solutions in Vue.js, PHP/CodeIgniter, and Shopify ecosystems, giving me a versatile toolbox to approach modern software challenges.

I’m continuously exploring software architecture, automation, and AI-powered solutions, with a mindset of bridging technology and business strategy. Outside of work, you’ll often find me experimenting with new projects, traveling, writing on my blog, or diving into the latest in tech and product development.
